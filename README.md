# CS250-Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
The Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from my Final Project.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I am able to interpret user needs and implement them into a program by typically seeing what is possible first and communicate with my team about how to go about meeting the user needs appropraitely. I can use user stories to better help achieve this due to the more details the user stories provide along with a direction I can head toward.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Communication is the most important part to me when it comes to developing a program, I can spend many hours working on something just for it to be thrown down the drain due to a lack of communication. Scrum meeting is a agile processes I think will certainly encompass what I believe to be the best approach in developing programs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member contributes in discussions and offers advice to issues people may be having during scrum meetings. Another part of being a good team member would be acomplishing the expected work for every sprint and relaying issues to ensure progress is being made.
